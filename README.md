In this repository, we provide slides from our Minisymposium on Sustainable and Robust Linear Algebra Computations at Exascale held at SIAM LA 2021.

## Abstract

The energy consumption constraint at Exascale encourages scientists to revisit the hardware design as well as the floating-point arithmetic in frequently used algorithms. The development of the first is also motivated by the rise of DL/ ML simulations that are satisfied with FP32, FP16, bfloat, or even 8 bits. The work on algorithms follows the lagom principle (just the right amount) for working precision to ensure the correct execution with the certain accuracy guarantee. In this minisymposium, we gather researchers from Europe and Japan in order to share and discuss different approaches for sustainable and robust linear algebra computations at Exascale covering hardware aspects, algorithms, and arithmetic tools. The Japanese effort is largely focused on hardware, e.g. the new Fugaku supercomputer (ranked number 1 in the TOP500 list) as well as the Cygnus supercomputer based on the CPU-GPU-FPGA heterogenous model. Europe aims to have the mixture of two: at one hand, the EPI project is to build the European processor(s) based on various hardware approaches like ARM, FPGA, and RISC-V; on the other hand, researchers propose a novel look on the algorithms design with the help of tools to support sustainable and robust computations. Our Minisymposium was split into two parts: [MS56](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=70592) and [MS63](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=70593)
